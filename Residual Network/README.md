## ResNet code
In order to implement the ideas in the paper, I reproduced the codes of 34 layers and 101 layers.
34 layers do not use dimension processing, while 101 layers do.
I will make detailed comments in the code for learning.

## Code and math comparison
For the mathematical ideas in the code and how to use code to implement mathematical ideas, you can see it in **math to code.pdf** in this folder
