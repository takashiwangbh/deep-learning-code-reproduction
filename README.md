## explanation
This repository is a reproduction of the code of some classic papers on deep learning. Each folder represents a paper. 

## folder composition:
**Each folder should contain:**
* A pdf of my understanding of the paper (should be as complete as the lecture)


* It includes annotated code implementation (the best way to learn a paper is to write code to implement it), this code can run normally, and I will also explain how to make the code run in the folder.


* The relationship between mathematics and code. I will explain how the mathematical ideas in the paper are implemented in the code, and I will try to be as detailed as possible. This will be a pdf file.
